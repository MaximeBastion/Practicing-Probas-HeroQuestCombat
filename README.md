# Practicing Probas: Hero Quest Combat
This project is a small exercise for me to practice some probas I am (re) learning in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
In this project I try to compute the probabilities for each outcome when a combat occurs in the board game "Hero: Quest".
If you want more explanations or to the see the code, please open the Jupyter Notebook file.
